# Borderlands in Transition: The U.S.-Mexican War and Native Sovereignty

## Course Description
This upper-level undergraduate seminar explores the complex intersections of indigenous sovereignty, territorial conflict, and imperial expansion during the U.S.-Mexican War (1846-1848). Using Brian DeLay's *War of a Thousand Deserts* as a central text, we examine the conflict not merely as a bilateral war but as a multi-sided struggle involving Native nations, Mexican communities, and Anglo-American settlers. The course adopts Ford Madox Ford's literary techniques of fragmented narrative and shifting perspective as a framework for analyzing primary source bias and historical memory.

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze the U.S.-Mexican War as a borderlands conflict involving multiple sovereign actors.
- Evaluate primary sources with attention to authorship, audience, and purpose.
- Apply interdisciplinary methods (historical, literary, Indigenous studies) to understand the past.
- Collaborate in building a digital course reader that reflects ongoing scholarly conversation.
